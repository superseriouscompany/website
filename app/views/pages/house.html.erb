  <p>
    Portugal's living costs are among the lowest of all developed countries'.
    The U.S. is the 21st most expensive country to live in; Portugal is the 54th.

    Relative to other inexpensive countries, Portugal has screaming fast (1Gb/s) Internet speeds.

    The surf is disgustingly epic. Peniche boasts a dozen world class breaks, one of which is the famed Supertubos, stop #10 on the World Tour.
    Santi and Neil once planned to get barreled here on the daily.

    The current time in Peniche is around <%= Time.now.in_time_zone('Lisbon').strftime("%-I:%m%p").downcase%>.
